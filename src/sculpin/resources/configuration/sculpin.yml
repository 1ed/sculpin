# Sculpin settings
#
# Many of these settings are either not commonly used or are
# changed and set programatically. For the sake of simplicity,
# many of these settings refer to top level configuration
# keys (for example, sculpin.dir.source refers to source) but
# internally (sculpin itself as well as any plugins) should
# rely on the sculpin.* keys as they are considered authoritative.
