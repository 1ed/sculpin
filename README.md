Sculpin - Static Site Generator
===============================

Sculpin is a PHP static site generator.

Sculpin takes plain old text files (Markdown, Textile, etc.) and combines
them with Twig templates to produce a set of static HTML files that can
be easily deployed to almost any hosting platform.
