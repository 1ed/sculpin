Not Invented Here

There are other fine projects that are more mature than this one.
If you are looking for a stable project with an established community,
try something on the following admittedly incomplete list:

 * [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) &mdash; Ruby
 * [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde) &mdash; Python
 * [Phrozn](http://phrozn.info) &mdash; PHP
 * [Octopress](http://octopress.org) &mdash; Ruby (framework on top of Jekyll)
